# PyTorch Coding Series Beginner to Advanced Architecture Implementation

This repo is made in a lieu to combine and refactor all relevant PyTorch codes with code comments and instructions for CV / NLP so that it's easy to interpret for beginners as well as experienced studetns/professionals

This work is a culumination of various available online free sources and a try to compile them in a neat way at one place possible

- PyTorch Beginner - Intermediate Deep Lizard tutorials source code

Deep Lizard's PyTorch Playlist is probably the best as of now - it starts from clearing fundametal concepts of tensors right upto using 
TensorBoard for Hyper Parameter testing and tuning and concepts like Batch Normalisation (more content might be added later on)

- PyTorch Intermediate - Advanced tutorials - Aladdin Persson

If you already know the basics of PyTorch, this could be an awesome playlist for you to develop your skills further. It includes implementation of various Deep Learning Architectures like LeNet, InceptionNet, ResNet, GANs etc in a simple, lucid manner.

Further, a lot many medium blog posts and stackoverflow topics have helped me to learn all this stuff! Citing all of them might be difficult but kudos to all the open source developers and a heartfelt gratitude for posting out the good stuff!! Thanks for the inspiration!

If you want to CONTRIBUTE to this repo, feel free to open a pull request :)! Free education for everyone!

It's a lot messy and vague right now, hopefully will clean this and re-organise it pro
